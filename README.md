# Koakuma-Ai
My attempt at making an Open Source version of RoboNitori.
Based on the Minitori project by Googie2149.

__Instalation Instructions:__
Build and Compile once, bot should automatically make a config file inside the bin folder.
Edit the config.json file with your token and other info.
Move objects.txt into the bin folder.

Bot should work at this point.  Use Discords O2Auth to add to servers.
